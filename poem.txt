Little things in everyday,
Little feelings in our hearts, and everything
All start to take the colours of their own

What if every day
Always overlayed
Shaded gray
What if all the stars
Faded with the day
They will shine on brighter
Day by day

Even though my dreams have slowly faded,lost their shine
the long dark night will surely break when morning comes at last
the map that i am drawing right now with own my hands
illuminate every step i have walked through my life 
spinning compass, untaken path twinkling gently in the morning light

Look at the shooting stars
Shimmering from afar
How they sparkle in the sky
Somehow they felt so long
Moments are passing on
As if frozen in time
Even if shadows dye the evening skies
Our story hasn't ended
When goodbyes are all I know
I just want to hear you say
See you soon


from Chorus 2 of memories of kindness
and pre chorus 1 from Irodori canvas
and target for love and from kokoro gradation
